Documentation for Logbook
=========================

Welcome to the Logbook documentation.  Logbook is a logging sytem for
Python that replaces the standard library's logging module.  It was
designed for complex and simple applications in mind.

This library is still under heavy development and the API is not fully
finalized yet.  Feedback is appreciated.  The docs here only show a tiny,
tiny feature set and are terrible incomplete.  We will have better docs
soon, but until then we hope this gives a sneak peak about how cool
Logbook is.  If you want more, have a look at the comprehensive
`testsuite`_.
