  from a factory function.
- Implemented maximum buffer size for the
  :class:`logbook.more.FingersCrossedHandler` as well as a lock
  for thread safety.

- Moved bubbling flags and filters to the handler object.
- Moved context processors on their own stack.

- The :class:`logbook.TestHandler` now keeps the record open

- The traceback is now removed from a log record when the record
  is closed.  The formatted traceback is a cached property
  instead of a function.

  records to handlers independently of a logger (uses the default
