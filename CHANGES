Version 0.2
-----------

Release date to be announced.

- Implemented default with statement for handlers which is an
  alias for `threadbound`.
- `applicationbound` and `threadbound` return the handler now.
- Implemented channel recording on the log records.
- the :class:`logbook.more.FingersCrossedHandler` now is set to
  `ERROR` by default and has the ability to create new loggers
  from a factory function.
- implemented maximum buffer size for the
  :class:`logbook.more.FingersCrossedHandler` as well as a lock
  for thread safety
- added ability to filter for context.
- moved bubbling flags and filters to the handler object.
- moved context processors on their own stack.
- removed the iter_context_handlers function.
- renamed `NestedHandlerSetup` to :class:`~logbook.NestedSetup`
  because it can now also configure processors.
- added the :class:`logbook.Processor` class.
- there is no difference between logger attached handlers and
  context specific handlers any more.
- added a function to redirect warnings to logbook
  (:func:`logbook.compat.log_warnings_to`)
